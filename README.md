# Advanced-Modeling-for-Predicting-Flight-Departure-Delays

## Overview

This project aims to predict flight departure delays in the United States, offering valuable insights into the factors influencing delays in the aviation industry. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we explore correlations between airport busyness, airline size, airport terrain, and departure delays. Leveraging innovative techniques, including a novel neural network architecture for regression analysis and clustering-based categorical encoding, our research provides actionable insights for optimizing airline economics and enhancing passenger experiences.

## Novel Key Features

- **Categorical Encoding:** Our unique clustering-based categorical encoding algorithm efficiently handles over 9000 unique categorical values within the dataset. This robust solution ensures a meaningful representation of diverse categorical data.

- **Neural Network Architecture:** We utilize a state-of-the-art neural network architecture designed for mixed data types, allowing us to capture intricate patterns in the dataset. The model considers both categorical and numerical features, providing accurate predictions for flight departure delays.


## Dataset Description
The dataset employed in this study is comprehensive, spanning flight data from January 2018 to August 2023. It incorporates a diverse set of features, comprising detailed flight specifics, weather parameters, and geospatial information. With a total of 100,584,764 rows, the dataset's considerable size demands the application of sophisticated data processing methods and analytical approaches.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Handling Missing Values:** We address missing values in the dataset, excluding unsuitable columns and employing interpolation strategies where applicable. This meticulous data preparation ensures the reliability of subsequent analyses.

- **Standardization:** Numerical features are standardized to eliminate scale-related disparities, enabling fair and unbiased comparisons among features. This enhances the interpretability and performance of subsequent modeling and analytical procedures.

- **Categorical Encoding:** Our distinctive clustering-based categorical encoding algorithm efficiently manages over 9000 unique categorical values, ensuring a meaningful representation of diverse categorical data.

- **Outlier Removal:** Outliers, defined as values exceeding 3 standard deviations from the mean, are identified and removed to enhance model performance.

### Feature Selection

To mitigate multicollinearity, we strategically remove one feature from each correlated pair. Feature selection techniques, including correlation heatmaps and regression analysis, guide the identification of influential features.

### Regression Analysis

- **Neural Network Architecture:** We employ a novel neural network architecture designed for mixed data types, featuring multiple input layers for categorical and numerical features. This architecture captures semantic relationships, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns.

- **LightGBM Regression:** The LightGBM Regressor outperforms other regression models, leveraging its ability to handle complex relationships and non-linearities in the dataset.

### Classification Analysis

To facilitate classification, the target variable (DepDelay) is transformed into binary values. Various classification algorithms, including Random Forest, are employed to predict flight delays.
